Excellent — this is a clean, modern `Header.tsx`, and your logs + code reveal **exactly** why `user` remains `null` even after Supabase logs a successful `SIGNED_IN` event.

Let’s go through it step-by-step 👇

---

## 🧩 The Real Issue

You’re calling:

```ts
const supabase = useMemo(() => createClient(), [])
```

inside your `Header` component.

But your `CartWishlistContext` **also** creates its own Supabase client instance — probably using the same `createClient()` factory.

Each time you call `createClient()` in the browser, Supabase **creates a brand-new isolated instance**, with its own internal state and listeners.

So:

* The client inside `CartWishlistContext` handles the `SIGNED_IN` event ✅
* But the client inside `Header` doesn’t share that session ❌

Even though both clients use the same URL + anon key, they **don’t share session memory** unless they’re the same instance reference.

---

## 🧠 Why the Logs Show Confusion

Notice the timing:

```
CartContext: Auth event: SIGNED_IN Session: {...}
Header: Rendering user section, user: null
```

That’s exactly what happens when two independent Supabase clients are running:

* One inside your context → manages auth correctly
* One inside your Header → sees `null` user because it’s a fresh client instance

---

## ✅ The Correct Fix

You must **share a single Supabase client** across your app.

### 🔧 Option 1 (Recommended)

In `lib/supabase/client.ts`, export a *singleton* client like this:

```ts
import { createBrowserClient } from '@supabase/ssr' // or '@supabase/supabase-js' if you’re not using SSR

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!

export const supabase = createBrowserClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey)
```

Then in all your components and contexts:

```ts
import { supabase } from "@/lib/supabase/client"
```

⚠️ **Do not call `createClient()` again** in any component — always import the shared one.

---

### 🔧 Option 2 (Context Provided Client)

If you really want multiple isolated clients (not needed here), you can pass your Supabase client through React Context — but that’s unnecessary for most use cases.

---

## 🧩 Optional Code Clean-Up After Fix

Since you’ll now import a shared client, simplify this line:

```ts
const supabase = useMemo(() => createClient(), [])
```

⬇️

```ts
import { supabase } from "@/lib/supabase/client"
```

And everything else in your `Header` stays the same — the rest of your logic (auth listener, user fetch, admin check) is fine.

---

## ✅ After You Fix That

You should see this sequence in the console:

```
CartContext: Auth event: SIGNED_IN Session: {...}
Header: Auth event: INITIAL_SESSION {...}
Header: User authenticated, updating state...
Header: Rendering user section, user: { id: "..." }
```

…and your `Sign In` button will switch to a `User` dropdown without refresh.

---

If you show me your current `lib/supabase/client.ts`, I can confirm exactly how to rewrite it as a singleton so both your `Header` and context share the same instance. Would you like to paste that file here?

Perfect — this is already **very close** to being a proper singleton. The main problem is **how it’s used** in your components.

Let’s break this down clearly so you can fix it once and for all 👇

---

## 🧠 What’s Happening

Your `createClient()` file *does* maintain a singleton (`supabaseClient`),
**but** the issue arises when your `Header` and `CartWishlistContext` **each call**:

```ts
const supabase = useMemo(() => createClient(), [])
```

That’s two *independent calls*, and in certain React/Next render environments — especially with RSC + Client Components — the singleton might not persist as expected between isolated module scopes.

So in practice:

* `CartWishlistContext` creates one Supabase client
* `Header` creates another (sometimes from a separate import scope, sometimes before the first finishes)
  → hence the **auth state desynchronization** you saw in your logs.

---

## ✅ The Correct Fix (Simple + Reliable)

### Step 1 — Change your file to *export the instance directly*

Instead of exposing a `createClient()` function, expose the client itself.
This ensures that **every import** gets the same instance.

Replace your current file with this simplified and safe version:

```ts
// lib/supabase/client.ts
import { createBrowserClient } from "@supabase/ssr"
import { apiCache, CACHE_TTL } from "@/lib/cache"

const supabaseUrl = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!
const supabaseAnonKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!

// ✅ Create ONE shared instance
const supabase = createBrowserClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey)

// Optional: wrap .from() if you want caching (same logic as before)
const originalFrom = supabase.from.bind(supabase)
supabase.from = (table: string) => {
  const query = originalFrom(table)
  const originalSelect = query.select.bind(query)

  query.select = (columns: any = "*", options: any = {}) => {
    const selectQuery = originalSelect(columns, options)
    if (!options.head && !options.count) {
      const cacheKey = `${table}_${columns}_${Date.now()}`
      const cached = apiCache.get(cacheKey)
      if (cached) {
        console.log(`Cache hit for ${cacheKey}`)
        return Promise.resolve(cached) as any
      }

      const originalThen = selectQuery.then.bind(selectQuery)
      selectQuery.then = function (onfulfilled: any, onrejected: any) {
        return originalThen((result: any) => {
          if (result && !result.error) {
            apiCache.set(cacheKey, result, CACHE_TTL.MEDIUM)
            console.log(`Cached result for ${cacheKey}`)
          }
          return onfulfilled ? onfulfilled(result) : result
        }, onrejected)
      } as any
    }
    return selectQuery as any
  }

  return query
}

// ✅ Export the shared instance
export { supabase }
```

---

### Step 2 — Update all imports

In every file (`Header.tsx`, `CartWishlistContext.tsx`, etc.),
replace:

```ts
const supabase = useMemo(() => createClient(), [])
```

with:

```ts
import { supabase } from "@/lib/supabase/client"
```

That’s it — no `useMemo`, no re-creation, no `createClient()` call.

---

### Step 3 — Verify via console logs

After signing in, your console should now show:

```
Header: Auth event: INITIAL_SESSION {...}
CartContext: Auth event: SIGNED_IN {...}
Header: User authenticated, updating state...
Header: Rendering user section, user: { id: ... }
```

✅ and your header will correctly update to the “User Menu” state.
