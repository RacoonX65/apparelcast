const https = require('https');

const YOCO_SECRET_KEY = 'sk_live_YOUR_LIVE_SECRET_KEY'; // Your live key
const PRODUCTION_DOMAIN = 'https://your-domain.com'; // Your domain

const webhookData = {
  name: 'ApparelCast Production Webhook',
  url: `${PRODUCTION_DOMAIN}/api/yoco/webhook`
};

// ... (rest of webhook registration code)
```

### Step 3: Update Webhook Secret
